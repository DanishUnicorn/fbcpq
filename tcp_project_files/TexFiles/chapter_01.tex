\section*{Content}
The course focuses on developing capacities for sustainable production of tropical crops. The students will be exposed to major crop science elements that are instrumental for a sustainable crop production. Focus is on optimizing the use of agrobiodiversity and management practices considering the socio-economic characteristics and climate change challenges.

\vspace{1em}
Main disciplines are:

\vspace*{0.5em}
i. Agronomy with reference to tropical conditions.

Tropical crop physiology; crop genetic resources, agrobiodiversity and breeding; crop management; crop protection; soil fertility. Cultivation of crops under challenging conditions of climate change (e.g drought, salinity).

\vspace*{0.5em}
ii. Tropical Crops

An overview of major tropical crops groups in relation to their uses (roots and tubers; legumes; minor cereals; spices; stimulants; underutilized species), their intrinsic properties and their cultivation with special emphasis on small-holder conditions and resilience for climate change.

\vspace*{0.5em}
iii. Cropping systems

Crop production optimization strategies for sustainable production (intercropping, use of legumes for mitigation/adaptation). Innovations to optimize sustainable production systems (crop: phenotyping, breeding, protection). The use of agrobiodiversity for diversification, sustainable intensification and value chain enhancement.


\section*{Learning Outcome}
Provide students, having a BSc-level background in agricultural, social sciences or sciences involved with development of the tropical region, with a comprehensive understanding of the properties of selected tropical environments, crop species and their management facing climate change. Focus is on climate related production constraints; that is abiotic and biotic stresses, and human endeavor to optimize crop production in small-scale farming, within the context of poverty alleviation and sustainable crop production.

    \begin{tabular}{ l | p{10cm} }
        Credit & 7.5 ECTS \\ 
        
        Type of assessment & Oral examination, 30 min \\ 

        Type of assessment details & During the course the student participate in group work in which they write a group report (approximate 10 pages). The students are individually examined in the content of the group report and are further examined in the rest of course curriculum. Examination in the report weight 35 \% and examination in curriculum weight 65 \%. No preparation time before the oral examination. \\

        Examination prerequisites & Submitted and approval of the reports for theoretical and practical exercises \\ 

        Aid & All aids allowed \\

        Marking scale & 7-point grading scale \\

        Censorship form &   \begin{itemize}
                                \item No external censorship
                                \item Several internal examiners
                            \end{itemize} \\

        Re-exam &   \begin{itemize}
                        \item As the ordinary exam.

                        \item If the student did not participate in a approved group report, an assignment is given three weeks before the exam. The student has to hand in an individual report based on the assignment (approximate 5 pages). At the oral examination the students will then be examined in the report and in the rest of the curriculum. Examination in the rapport weight 35 \% and examination in curriculum weight 65 \%.
