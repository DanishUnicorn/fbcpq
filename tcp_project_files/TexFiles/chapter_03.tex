\subsection*{How to increase soil fertility of degraded soils?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In this exercise we will discuss possible ways to improve the fertility of degraded soils. We discuss different options in groups. After the group discussions we will discuss in plenum.
    \item Your inputs for the discussion counts as the deliverable of the exercise.
    \item Potential Management Options to increase SOM:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Integration of legumes as intercrops or in rotation
        \item Inorganic fertilizer
        \item Manure (livestock)
        \item Green manure, mulching, residue retention
        \item Agroforestry techniques (including fallowing)
        \item No tillage
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the benefits of the option?
    \item Which problems could (potentially) limit the adoption?
    \item What are possible solutions to the problems/limitations?
\end{enumerate}
