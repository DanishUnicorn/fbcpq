This chapter of the course notes compiles the exam questions for the course held in November 2025, along with their respective answers prepared by me. The purpose of this section is twofold: firstly, to provide a reflective exercise that consolidates understanding of the course material; and secondly, to document my comprehension of the course topics as assessed through the exam questions.

To ensure citation accuracy and academic transparency, NotebookLM has been employed as the primary generative AI platform. Its use has focused on verifying that all citations accurately reference the uploaded course materials and lecture slides provided by the professors. Beyond citation control, this section also represents an ongoing exploration of prompt engineering — refining interaction design to optimise AI output quality, precision, and academic reliability. Through this approach, the work aims to maintain a high academic standard while enhancing clarity, structure, and depth in written responses.

There are a total of 17 questions in the exam, each comprising between three and five sub-questions. The numbering of the sections in this chapter corresponds directly to the numbering of the exam questions, ensuring a clear and consistent structure throughout. Questions 1-9 address aspects related to crop physiology, while questions 10-17 focus on fruit quality, maturity, and usability. Each question is presented below, followed by its respective sub-questions and answers.

\section*{Questions within: Crop Physiology aspects}

\section{Yield and quality determinants and components}
\textbf{Shoot and bud development, growth and flower bud development}

\subsection{Characterise the development and importance of spurs and extension (long) shoots}

A \textit{spur} is a short, slow-growing lateral branch that bears flower buds, while an \textit{extension shoot} is a long, one-year shoot responsible for primary growth and framework development, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:spur_extension}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Spurs}
    \subitem \textit{Development:} As seen in the figure, spurs are short side branches that develop from lateral buds on older wood. They grow slowly over several years, forming compact structures with closely spaced buds. 
    \subitem \textit{Importance:} Spurs are perennial and bear flower buds, making them the main sites of flowering and fruit production. Their stability ensures regular cropping and helps maintain yield consistency.
    
    \item \textbf{Extension shoots}
    \subitem \textit{Development:} The long shoot, labelled as the extension shoot in the figure, originates from terminal or vigorous lateral buds and grows actively during one season. It extends the framework of the branch system and promotes primary growth.
    \subitem \textit{Importance:} Extension shoots are essential for canopy renewal and positioning of future spurs. They provide space and light for developing buds and balance vegetative and reproductive growth.
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{extension shoot} represents one-year primary growth that elongates the branch. \textbf{Spurs} are short, slow-growing side branches that develop on older wood and typically carry \textbf{flower buds}, which later form fruit. \textbf{Vegetative buds} along the extension shoot give rise to new shoots or leaves in the following season.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Describe differences in bud development and structure between stone and pome fruits}

An example of a pome fruit and a stone fruit are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pome_stone_buds}. The key differences in bud development lie in the presence of mixed buds in pome fruits, which contain both floral and vegetative tissues allowing continued growth after flowering, whereas stone fruits have separate simple buds where flowering terminates growth at that point \cite*{rm_02_L03_buds_bud_development,rm_03_L04_flower_bud_formation}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pome fruits}
    \subitem Possess \textit{mixed flower buds} that contain leaves, flowers, and a bourse-shoot bud, allowing the shoot to continue growing after flowering \cite*{rm_02_L03_buds_bud_development}. These mixed buds typically develop six to seven flowers \cite*{rm_03_L04_flower_bud_formation}.

    \item \textbf{Stone fruits}
    \subitem Have \textit{simple or naked flower buds} that contain only leaves or only flowers \cite*{rm_02_L03_buds_bud_development}. The development of a stone fruit flower bud results in the loss of the growth point at that position, often leaving bare sections along the shoot in certain cultivars. Stone fruit flower buds generally produce fewer flowers, typically one to five \cite*{rm_02_L03_buds_bud_development}.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Comparison of bud development and structure in pome and stone fruits. \textbf{Pome fruits} (left) such as apple and pear have \textit{mixed buds} containing leaves, flowers, and a bourse-shoot bud that allows continued growth after flowering. \textbf{Stone fruits} (right) such as cherry and peach possess \textit{simple buds}, where flower and vegetative buds are separate; once flowering occurs, the growth at that position ceases.}

\subsection{Describe some important yield components in strawberry and in sour cherry}

Important yield components determine the final fruit yield per hectare (t/ha) as the product of fruit number and fruit size \cite*{rm_01_L02_fruit_yield_quality}. The main yield-determining factors differ between strawberry and sour cherry due to differences in reproductive structures and growth habits:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Strawberry}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The \textit{number of plants per hectare} forms the base for yield potential and depends on the growing system and establishment of rooted runners \cite*{rm_01_L02_fruit_yield_quality}.
            \item \textit{Berry weight} is a major component that correlates linearly with the number of achenes (the seeds on the surface of the berry) per berry at a given density \cite*{rm_07.2_L11_13_fruit_growth_quality}.
            \subitem Achenes stimulates flesh growth through hormone production, increasing the berry size \cite*{rm_07.1_L11_13_fruit_growth_quality}.
            \item \textit{Flower quality} determines the number of ovule primordia (the early stage of seed development inside the flower) and hence potential achene number, directly influencing final berry size \cite*{rm_07.1_L11_13_fruit_growth_quality}.
            \item \textit{Berry number per plant} depends on vegetative growth and spacing; higher inflorescence numbers (flower clusters) may increase fruit count but reduce berry size due to competition \cite*{rm_07.1_L11_13_fruit_growth_quality}.
        \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Sour cherry}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \textit{number and type of buds} are crucial yield components. Sour cherry has simple flower buds that contain either flowers or leaves, and flowering terminates growth at that site \cite*{rm_02_L03_buds_bud_development}. High yields can therefore reduce bud formation for the following season due to limited shoot growth \cite*{rm_03_L04_flower_bud_formation}.
        \item Each bud produces \textit{one to five flowers per cluster}, depending on cultivar \cite*{rm_07.1_L11_13_fruit_growth_quality}.
        \item \textit{Fruit size} is genetically limited by low sink activity (the ability to attract nutrients from the tree), although minor increases occur when fruit numbers are reduced \cite*{rm_07.2_L11_13_fruit_growth_quality}.
        \item For processing cultivars, yield quality also depends on traits such as \textit{sugar content, acidity, ascorbic acid, anthocyanins, and aroma compounds}, which define fruit value for juice production \cite*{rmb_04_L21_postharvest_biology_technology_fruits_vegetables_flowers}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
