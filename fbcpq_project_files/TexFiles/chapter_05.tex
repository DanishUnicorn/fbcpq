This chapter of the course notes compiles the exam questions for the course held in November 2025, along with their respective answers prepared by me. The purpose of this section is twofold: firstly, to provide a reflective exercise that consolidates understanding of the course material; and secondly, to document my comprehension of the course topics as assessed through the exam questions.

To ensure citation accuracy and academic transparency, NotebookLM has been employed as the primary generative AI platform. Its use has focused on verifying that all citations accurately reference the uploaded course materials and lecture slides provided by the professors. Beyond citation control, this section also represents an ongoing exploration of prompt engineering â€” refining interaction design to optimise AI output quality, precision, and academic reliability. Through this approach, the work aims to maintain a high academic standard while enhancing clarity, structure, and depth in written responses.

There are a total of 17 questions in the exam, each comprising between three and five sub-questions. The numbering of the sections in this chapter corresponds directly to the numbering of the exam questions, ensuring a clear and consistent structure throughout. Each question is presented below, followed by its respective sub-questions and answers.

\section{1: Yield and quality determinants and components}
\textbf{Shoot and bud development, growth and flower bud development}

\subsection{Characterise the development and importance of spurs and extension 
(long) shoots}
\subsection{Describe differences in bud development and structure between stone 
and pome fruits}
\subsection{Describe some important yield components in strawberry and in sour 
cherry}
\subsection{Describe some conditions which may affect the development of 
flower buds negatively}


\section{Yield and quality determinants and components}
\textbf{Flowers, pollination and fruit set (sterility and fertility)}

\subsection{Describe important factors determining fruit set? }
\subsection{What is the importance of EPP?}
\subsection{What are important quality parameters for pollen and flowers?}
\subsection{Why and how do we use pollinators?}
\subsection{Are insects (fx bees) needed in pollination of self-pollinating crops?}
